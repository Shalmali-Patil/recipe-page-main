### Links
- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Used Flexbox to align the vertical components.
Used font-face to import the font files.
Aligning the text in the list under Instructions section took some time. Here is the CSS I used for this:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

### Continued development

I used Pixel Perfect Pro browser extension to match the given design. However, there is scope for improvement here.
